# Star Trek RPG

This is a simple click based RPG using characters from Star Trek: The Next Generation. It's simple by there being only one attack button, but you have four different enemies and you have to defeat them in a certain order.

Captain Picard has been captured by the Borg. It's up to you to save him!
